# mean-chat

A simple chat application written using the MEAN stack.

This is mostly just a way for me to learn the stack.

## Roadmap

To begin with, I'm going to follow the tutorial on https://scotch.io/tutorials/creating-a-single-page-todo-app-with-node-and-angula and https://scotch.io/tutorials/node-and-angular-to-do-app-application-organization-and-structurer to create a todo app with the mean stack.

I'm not going to follow the tutorial verbatim (e.g. I'll use a coding style that works better with ECMA2015, and also I might use a slightly different database schema).

Then once that is working, I'll change it so that it's a chat website (like messenger.com) instead of a todo app.

I'm starting with a tutorial because I not yet familiar with best practices and what the MEAN stack should feel like, and I think at least for now, starting with a tutorial might be better at helping me learn that more quickly than by starting from scratch.
